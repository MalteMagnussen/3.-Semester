// 7) Change the functionality to get a new quote every hour. (Hint: use setInterval() )

// I don't understand this task. Like, if you click the button, and the JSON endpoint has a new joke, then it shows the new joke.
// The joke has changed while I was working on this. Like, it takes a joke from the endpoint.
// And the endpoint changes jokes by itself every hour. I dont understand what they want here. 

// Use developer-tools in your browser and itâ€™s network options to monitor the AJAX-request. 
// Explain why, what you did above, is even possible, 
// when we know the Same Origin Policy governs when/where AJAX-request can go

// Imma be real with you. 
// I have no fucking clue what "Same Origin Policy" even is. 
// And I've read several webpages about it so far. 
// Read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy
// It is something about security.
