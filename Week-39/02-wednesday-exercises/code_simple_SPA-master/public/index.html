<!-- Small application to display a quote of the hour
1) Remove all html (and only this) inside the div with the container class  (in index.htm in the public folder)
2) Add a button to the file + an empty div-tag, both with id’s so they are easy to “find”
3) In index.js remove all code meant for the initial joke-sample, 
    add an event listener to the button’s click event and pass a callback 
    that will update the div tag in the index.html with a new quote.
4) Initially, fetch the quote from a remote API: https://studypoints.info/jokes/api/jokes/period/hour 
5) Use fetch() to get the quote.
6) Use developer-tools in your browser and it’s network options to monitor the AJAX-request.
    Explain why, what you did above, is even possible, when we know the Same Origin Policy governs when/where AJAX-request can go
7) Change the functionality to get a new quote every hour. (Hint: use setInterval() )
